      "The initial brand design I tackled was my own. In crafting this design, I aimed to infuse it with elements of my personality, including my preferred color, hobbies, and interests. Drawing inspiration from the minimalist yet sophisticated aesthetic of my beloved perfume brand, Diptyque, I sought to create a logo that shows elegance. The resulting logo seamlessly integrates my initials, A and S, imbuing it with a personal touch while maintaining a clean, uncomplicated design. In selecting colors, I drew from my fondness for floral hues, opting for soft, natural tonesâ€”beige and pink, complemented by hints of earthy browns and lush greens. This theme extends to my website, where the brand's color palette, typography, and overall style converge harmoniously, creating a design that resonates with me.",

      'Medicell, a product developed by MJ Company, is designed to alleviate pain, reduce swelling, and restore muscle function through its innovative skin-lift technology. I collaborated with MJ Company, a Japanese-based firm, to create their product catalog for international promotion. Initially, in Japanese, I spearheaded the design of their first English catalog. I focused on their company motto, "Transforming Lives with Skin-Life Innovation." Considering the cultural differences between Japan and the Western audience, I aimed for a design that prioritized simplicity and negative space, which resonates more with Western sensibilities. I also assisted in translating sections of the catalog, allowing me to delve deeper into its content. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and am eager to see Medicell succeed in international markets!',

      "Sentience, an EDM DJ/producer hailing from San Diego, CA, is the focus of my recent branding endeavor. With a personal connection to Sentience, I aimed to craft a brand that mirrors his musical essence. The name Sentience stems from the concept of consciousness and emotion. Sentience's music aims to evoke diverse emotional responses, a theme he wants to emphasize in his branding. To embody this concept, I designed a logo featuring a star encircled by a loop, symbolizing the moment of inspiration or \"spark.\" The typography chosen for the brand is deliberately simple, contrasting the logo's complexity. Considering Sentience's preference for a minimalist aesthetic, I ensured the design maintained simplicity throughout. Additionally, I developed mock-up designs for his merchandise, adding another layer of excitement to this engaging project.",
